As a participant, my team and I decided on one idea to be developed for the next 1 month. It was a Project-Based Learning where we learned all the basics from experts about User Experience and implemented it into our first idea, LiburOn. LiburOn is an improvement feature from existing apps like Shoppe & Tokopedia, and the improvements are

- 🚶‍♂️‍➡️ User Journey during buying specific tickets for an event
- 🎨 More accessible in terms of visual clarity
- 🚀 Personalized User Preferences

# What did I learn?

I learned many things, but the most important thing I got is summarized below.

## 🤖 Everything about UX

<div align="justify">
 I learned that the role of UX is so important before the development starts! UX needs to do its research, writing, interviews, design, and iterate. Therefore, it's essential to understand

- 🔍 Understanding of the Design Thinking framework
- 📃 Know the users through an Interview, understanding their pain points, and making them into one known persona
- 🚴‍♀️ Iterate the cycle of research because technology is constantly updated
- ⚙️ Testing, testing, and testing...
- 💢 Focus on the problem first, not the solution

All of that kind of stuff was what brought me to a UI/UX Designer role during that time.

# Conclusion

  I was having fun doing this project, I learned more about User Experience 🙂
  especially on understanding more about everyone's pain points ❌ and how to
  solve it using design thinking.✨
