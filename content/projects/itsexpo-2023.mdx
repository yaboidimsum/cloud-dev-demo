# What did I learn?

I learned many things, but the most important thing I got is summarized below.

## 🤩 Be a mentor, not just an expert staff

<div align="justify">
  "Expert Staff" is just a title 😅, what's important is what kind of impact and
  knowledge I gave to the staff, therefore they can use those skills and pieces
  of knowledge in other events!
</div>

## 🌍 Expand your knowledge!

<div align="justify">
  Although my role is a UI/UX Designer, I can increase my skills more,
  especially in Frontend, because both sides are related to how the design and
  flow work
</div>

# Conclusion

<div align="justify">
  This was my first time as a mentor! I'm glad that my knowledge and experience
  have brought my staff to other places! This first step is also my commitment
  to doing frontend development, see you shortly with my different role
