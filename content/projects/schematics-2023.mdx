# What did I learn?

I learned many things, but the most important thing I got is summarized below.

## 🐦‍🔥 Always ready for everything

<div className="flex justify-center rounded-xl pb-10 pt-4">

    alt="Team 4"
    layout="responsive"
    width={1920}
    height={1080}
    quality={100}
    className="h-auto w-full rounded-xl"
  />
</div>

<div align="justify">
  When my team and I designed the website, we weren't ready for any sponsor
  request 🥲 This one, for example, we need to ideate about where we should
  display this? New page? Or just put it on the home page. And turns out it fits
  more on the home page with our ways of design ✨

# Conclusion

<div align="justify">
  In the world full of uncertainty, be ready for everything.💖
