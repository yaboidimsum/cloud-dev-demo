<div align="justify">
  I was assigned to the Personal Colour Analysis team 😁. I implemented the
  pipeline from the customer face taken to output the customer's skin tone
  utilizing Python!🐍. I use [Google Face
  Landmark](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker)
  to extract some of the features from the face to be used, and I implemented
  the white balance to correctly extract the colors. There are 4 skin tones:
  warm, cool, summer, and winter, using the math formula and combining with
  fuzzy logic✨.

  I am a bit of a designer too!🎨. I had the chance to design the banner for the
  live collaboration used in Matahari Department Store

# What did I learn?

I learned many things, but the most important thing I got is summarized below.

## 🤖 Face Preprocessing

<div align="justify">
  Face preprocessing is utterly complicated 😓, when I built the pipeline for
  the Personal Color Analysis it involved in 4 steps
  - Customer face pose for the camera
  - Google Face Landmark extracted important parts 
  - White balance Implementation
  - Math formula and fuzzy logic
    
Steps 2-3 were not the problems; the 1st and 4th were. 
First, we need to ensure that the lighting is not too dark 🌑 or too bright ☀️ because it will affect how the WB works. The position also depends on how far the customer faces from the camera.

The fourth step is more "good" theoretically on paper 📃 rather than in implementation. Most of the skin tone still needs improvement, especially in summer and winter. We could improve if we had more data, time, and research ⌛.

# Conclusion

<div align="justify">
  I was having fun doing this project, I learned more about Computer Vision 🙂
  pipelining, and understood how certain areas of our faces 👨‍🦰 are capable of
  matching our outfits!🧢.
