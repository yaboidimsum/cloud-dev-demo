# What did I learn?

I learned many things, but the most important thing I got is summarized below.

## ü§© Never fall in love with your design

<div align="justify">
  As in my previous role in ITS Expo, I thought my design in ITS Expo could be
  implemented the same in UKM Expo, but no üòì I had to solve the problem where
  the creative team had other visions. My team and I need to design it the way
  the theme was. It was a Lego theme and we were having a hard time how to lay
  out those UKM (Unit Activity) because there were lots of them ‚ú®

# Conclusion

<div align="justify">
  In the world of design, never fall in love with your design because design
  changes, that's the conclusion üòÅ
