# Description

<div align="justify">
  So I've always been amazed by 3D art, and I want to master it. This is the
  first step I get into 3D using Blender ðŸ¤©, and surprisingly, the concept is
  "almost" the same as programming, I just need to get used to the user
  interface.
</div>

# What did I learn?

I learned many things, but the most important thing I got is summarized below.

## ðŸ¤– Blender Basics

<div align="justify">
I'll try to list everything I learned because there is a lot of terminology!

- ðŸŸ¦ Basic mesh shape
- ðŸ”¦ Different type of lighting
- ðŸ‘ª Parent and child concept
- ðŸ‘€ Conditional rendering

And now I've bought [Bruno Simons ThreeJS Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) you'll be seeing more 3D content from me in the near future ðŸ‘€

# Conclusion

<div align="justify">
  It was a fresh air for me to build this because I code a lot. Combining the
  concept between design and code will be a great, powerful opportunity for me
