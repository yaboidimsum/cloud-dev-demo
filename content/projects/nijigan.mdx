# My Jobdesk

<div align="justify">
  It's a small team 😓 so we were having multiple roles despite it being given
  separately, one role at the beginning. At first, I was tasked with an ablation
  study in comparison analysis, but I got involved more in the roles I mentioned
  below.

## 🔎 Comparison Analyst

<div align="justify">
  This is my quoted real job desk 😁, I and
  [Farah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farah-dhia-fadhila/) were to search other
  existing models to be compared later when our model is ready. It wasn't that
  hard for me because we were expected to find them, run 'em, and see their
  performances. But...

The challenges appeared when we needed to handle outdated modules and packages,
so we were not just running simply; we were fixing the existing code package and modules to the new
one while maintaining the same functionality. It took us three weeks to maintain everything.

## ⚙️ Model Engineer

</div>
<div align="justify">
  The team mostly brainstormed the proposed idea, model, and architecture
  together. I was involved in building some parts of the architecture by making
  it modular and implementing loss functions. I also built the validation module
  for NijiGAN, all utilizing the Pytorch framework.

## 💯 Mean Opinion Score Website

</div>
<div align="justify">
  So, on this MOS website, users will be shown randomly generated images from
  the models in the ablation study, which is the UI's visual representation. The
  details of the results can be seen in the paper. This part was pretty
  challenging 💢 because at that time I didn't understand the concepts of Server
  Side Rendering ☁️ and Client Side Rendering 👤, I was having a hard time
  showing the generated images while also facing errors that I didn't really
  understand 😭
</div>

# What did I learn?

I learned many things, but the most important thing I got is summarized below.

## 🤖 Encoder-Decoder

<div align="justify">
  Yea I learned about Encoder and Decoder that leads me to knowing more about
  Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder. Although our model is utilizing GAN,
  this Encoder-Decoder was used before it was scrapped from the NijiGAN
  architecture due to heavy load 😓. Thanks to
  [Kevin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-putra-santoso/) for teaching me
  this!
</div>

## ✨ Generative Adversarial Networks

<div align="justify">
  GAN is one of my favorites! Because the method is unique, I learned there are
  2 neural networks, the Generator and the Discriminator, that are playing
  MinMax Games. At first, the Generator will output a bad, unrealistic Image,
  and the Discriminator will easily tackle the fake image, and as time goes by,
   the Generator is getting good, and finally, the Discriminator cannot
  differentiate which one is real or fake. Shout out to
  [Kevin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-putra-santoso/) ((againnn)) for
  teaching me this!
</div>
## 👩‍🔬Neural ODE Blocks
<div align="justify">

This one is pretty complicated because I am an IT person not a Math Person. A neural ordinary differential equation (Neural ODE) is a type of
neural network architecture that combines concepts from ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) and deep learning. I can't really explain the whole thing here so this is
the paper for that! [NODE Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366)

</div>

## ⚡Server Side Rendering & Client Side Rendering

<div align="justify">
  One of the key takeaways from developing the MOS website was understanding the
  importance of SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and CSR (Client-Side Rendering). I
  realized that to make the image loading dynamic, SSR was essential so that the
  image would change every time it was loaded. At the same time, I had to ensure
  the tester's actions on the radio button were preserved, which could be
  achieved with CSR. This was something I didn't fully grasp at the beginning,
  but now, with this newfound knowledge, I feel much more confident and capable.

# Conclusion

<div align="justify">
  Throughout this research journey, I’ve gained valuable insights into complex
  model architectures, ranging from Encoder-Decoder frameworks to Generative
  Adversarial Networks (GANs). One of the key highlights was working on the MOS
  Website, where I learned the differences between Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
  and Client-Side Rendering (CSR) in Next.js. Although I started with little
  understanding, this experience sparked my enthusiasm to explore more about
  frontend frameworks, especially Next.js. 🤍

For closing, I improved my skills in PyTorch by contributing to developing validation modules for the NijiGAN project. We’ve submitted our work to ICCV 2025, and I’m hopeful it will be accepted and published. 🔥
