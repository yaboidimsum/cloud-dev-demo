# What did I learn?

I learned many things, but the most important thing I got is summarized below.

## 🎨 Design System Matters

<div align="justify">
  This is the first time I found that Design Systems are the key to design
  consistency. When we developed the website for the first time, I thought it
  would be fine without any Design Systems 🥹. But turns out the color keeps
  multiplying, components keep varying, and all other kinds of stuff that I
  can't say here🤯. So please, a word for designers, make your design system,
  and make it comfortable for developers by implementing design tokens🗝️

# Conclusion

<div align="justify">
  Communication between the designer and developer is a matter of talk, so talk
  it out!💞
