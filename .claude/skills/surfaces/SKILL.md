# Surfaces

Depth in an interface comes from how surfaces meet: the radius where they nest, the shadow or border that separates them, the gradient that fades them out. Most interfaces that feel "off" fail here — mismatched nested radii, harsh solid borders, banded gradients, or light-mode shadows pasted into dark mode. These are cheap to fix and compound into an interface that feels considered.

## Match the project's styling system

Before making changes, check how the project styles things — Tailwind, plain CSS, CSS Modules, or CSS-in-JS — and express every fix in that system. Don't introduce a `styles.css` full of custom classes into a Tailwind codebase, and don't inline Tailwind-style utilities into a styled-components project. Shadow and color tokens belong wherever the project keeps its design tokens (Tailwind `@theme` / config, `:root` variables, or the theme object).

## Core Principles

### 1. Derive nested radii, don't repeat them

A rounded child inside a rounded parent gets its radius by subtraction: `innerRadius = outerRadius − padding`. Copying the parent's radius onto the child makes the corner gap pinch — the single most frequent giveaway of an unpolished UI. The rule loses force once the gap between layers passes `24px`; at that distance the surfaces read as independent, so pick each radius on its own merits.

### 2. Shadows over borders for depth

Elements that use a border to signal elevation — cards, buttons, containers — should carry a stacked translucent `box-shadow` instead. Transparency composites with whatever sits underneath, so one token works everywhere; a solid border color is tuned to exactly one background. Keep real borders where the job is layout separation (dividers, table cells, form inputs).

### 3. Dark mode flattens shadows to rings

Stacked depth shadows can't be seen against dark surfaces. When the theme goes dark, collapse each shadow token down to one low-opacity white ring at 1px.

### 4. Hairline borders on retina

Dividers and fine lines should render at `0.5px` on high-density screens via a media-query-driven CSS variable, falling back to `1px` on standard displays.

### 5. Eased gradients, masks for fades

Plain linear gradients between solid colors band visibly — use eased gradients instead. For fading content out, prefer `mask-image` over a gradient overlay; masks work with whatever is behind them. Never put a fade on scrollable content — it cuts off what the user is trying to read.

### 6. Image outlines: pure black or pure white only

Every image gets a `1px` low-opacity outline for consistent depth. Light mode: black at 10%. Dark mode: white at 10%. Never a tinted neutral (slate, zinc, `#111827`) and never the accent color — a tinted line inherits whatever surface sits behind it and ends up looking like grime along the edge instead of a clean boundary.

### 7. Dark mode flips variables, not classes

Define colors as a numbered scale of CSS variables and swap the values under the dark theme selector. Don't scatter manual `dark:` overrides across components.

## Nested Radii

The inner radius is computed, never copied:

```css
/* Derived — corner gap stays even all the way around */
.dialog {
  border-radius: 16px;
  padding: 6px;
}
.dialog-body {
  border-radius: 10px; /* 16 − 6 */
}

/* Pinched — child repeats the parent's radius */
.dialog,
.dialog-body {
  border-radius: 16px;
}
```

```tsx
// Tailwind — subtract the padding when picking the child's radius
<section className="rounded-3xl p-3">   {/* 24px outer, 12px gap */}
  <article className="rounded-xl">      {/* 24 − 12 = 12px ✓ */}
    ...
  </article>
</section>
```

## Depth Without Borders

A card or button that draws a solid border to look raised has two problems: the color was picked against one specific background, and the edge reads flat. Replace it with a shadow stack built from three ingredients — a 1px spread that stands in for the border, a tight crisp layer just beneath the element, and a wider soft layer for ambient depth:

```css
:root {
  --elevation-raised:
    0 0 0 1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05),
    0 1px 3px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05),
    0 4px 10px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05);
  --elevation-raised-hover:
    0 0 0 1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.07),
    0 1px 3px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.07),
    0 4px 10px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.08);
}

/* Hook into however the project switches themes:
   a class, a data attribute, or prefers-color-scheme */
.dark {
  --elevation-raised: 0 0 0 1px rgb(255 255 255 / 0.09);
  --elevation-raised-hover: 0 0 0 1px rgb(255 255 255 / 0.14);
}
```

For hover, transition only the shadow — nothing else:

```css
.panel {
  box-shadow: var(--elevation-raised);
  transition: box-shadow 150ms ease-out;
}
.panel:hover {
  box-shadow: var(--elevation-raised-hover);
}
```

The lone spread ring is also useful on its own, anywhere a real hairline border sits awkwardly against its background:

```css
/* Ring shadow standing in for a 1px border */
box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.07);
```

Leave separation borders alone. A bottom border between list rows, a table's gridlines, or an input's visible edge is doing layout work, not depth work — converting those to shadows gains nothing, and on form fields it costs accessibility.

### Picking between the two

**Reach for a shadow** when the element reads as raised: cards, bordered button styles, menus, popovers, dialogs, anything that travels across mixed or image backgrounds, and hover/focus lift effects.

**Keep a border** when the line separates rather than elevates: row dividers, table gridlines, form-field edges (a visible outline is an accessibility feature), and hairline rules in dense layouts.

## Hairline Borders

For the borders you keep, use density-aware hairlines so dividers stay crisp on retina screens:

```css
:root {
  --border-hairline: 1px;

  @media only screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),
    only screen and (min-resolution: 192dpi) {
    --border-hairline: 0.5px;
  }
}

.divider {
  border-bottom: var(--border-hairline) solid var(--gray-6);
}
```

## Gradients and Fades

**Eased over linear.** Linear gradients between solid colors show banding. Use an eased gradient (multiple stops following an easing curve — generate with https://larsenwork.com/easing-gradients/).

**Mask over gradient overlay.** To fade content out, prefer `mask-image` — it composites with any content or background, where a gradient overlay only matches one background color:

```css
.fade-bottom {
  mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, black 80%, transparent);
}
```

**No fades on scrollable content.** A fade over a scrollable list restricts the viewable area and cuts off content the user is scrolling to read.

## Image Outlines

Photos and screenshots should carry the same edge treatment as every other surface: a 1px translucent line drawn just inside the image bounds.

```css
img {
  outline: 1px solid rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1);
  outline-offset: -1px; /* pulled inside — costs no layout space */
}

.dark img {
  outline-color: rgb(255 255 255 / 0.1);
}
```

```tsx
// Tailwind
<img
  alt={alt}
  src={src}
  className="-outline-offset-1 outline-1 outline-black/10 dark:outline-white/10"
/>
```

The color is fixed and not up for theming: black at 10% in light mode, white at 10% in dark. Palette neutrals (`outline-slate-*`, `outline-zinc-*`, `outline-neutral-*`) and accent colors are off the table — anything tinted picks up the surface color behind the image and looks like grime rather than a clean edge. Draw it with `outline` instead of `border` (no effect on box size), and inset it with `outline-offset: -1px` so the image keeps its intended dimensions.

## Dark Mode Surfaces

Use a numbered color scale as CSS variables and flip the values per theme:

```css
:root {
  --gray-1: #fafafa;
  --gray-2: #f5f5f5;
  --gray-12: #171717;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --gray-1: #171717;
  --gray-2: #1f1f1f;
  --gray-12: #fafafa;
}
```

In Tailwind projects, do not hand-write `dark:` color overrides per component. Point utilities at the variables and let the theme flip do the work:

```css
/* Good — variables flip automatically */
.button {
  background: var(--gray-12);
  color: var(--gray-1);
}

/* Avoid — manual overrides everywhere */
.button {
  @apply bg-gray-900 dark:bg-gray-100;
}
```

And remember the two dark-mode surface rules from above: shadows collapse to a single white ring, and image outlines switch to pure white at 10%.

## Symptoms and Their Fixes

- **Corners pinch where a rounded child meets its parent** — the child copied the radius; derive it instead (outer minus padding).
- **A card looks stamped onto the page rather than raised** — solid depth border; swap in the layered shadow token.
- **Cards disappear in dark mode** — the light shadow stack is still active; collapse it to the white ring.
- **Shadow hover feels laggy or heavy** — the element transitions `all`; scope the transition to `box-shadow` only.
- **Visible stripes across a large gradient** — banding; add eased intermediate stops.
- **A fade only looks right on one background** — it's a gradient overlay; rebuild it with `mask-image`.
- **A fade sits over a scrolling list** — remove it; it hides exactly what the user is scrolling toward.
- **Image edges look dirty or smudged** — tinted outline; switch to pure black/white at 10%.
- **`dark:` overrides sprinkled through every component** — flip a numbered variable scale at the theme root instead.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Inner radii derived (outer − padding) wherever rounded surfaces nest
- [ ] Cards, buttons, and containers signal depth with shadow tokens, not solid borders
- [ ] Separation borders left intact — and hairline-thin on high-DPI screens
- [ ] Dark theme collapses every shadow stack to a single white ring
- [ ] Large gradients eased; fades built with `mask-image`; nothing fading over a scroll area
- [ ] Every image carries the 1px inset outline — pure black/white at 10%, never tinted
- [ ] Themes switch by flipping variables, not per-component `dark:` classes
