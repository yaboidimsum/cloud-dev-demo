# Interface Animations

Animation in a product interface is feedback, not decoration. The best UI animations go unnoticed — they make the interface feel fast, connected, and physical, then get out of the way. Default to less: a fast, well-eased 200ms transition beats an elaborate 500ms sequence every time. When in doubt, don't animate. When you do animate, be exact — easing and duration are decisions, not defaults you inherit from a snippet.

**Match the project's stack.** Before writing any animation code, check what the project already uses: plain CSS transitions/keyframes, Tailwind, Motion (`motion`/`framer-motion` in package.json), React Spring, or WAAPI. Write animations in that system. Never add an animation library for something CSS transitions can do, and never hand-roll spring physics when Motion is already installed.

## Decision Framework 1: Should this animate at all?

Ask how often the user will trigger it:

- **100+ times a day** (command menu, keyboard navigation, tab switching in a power tool) → **No animation.** Speed beats smoothness. Raycast doesn't animate its menu for exactly this reason.
- **Keyboard-initiated action** (arrow-key list navigation, shortcuts, focus movement) → **Never animate.** Keyboard users are moving fast; animation makes the UI feel disconnected from their input.
- **Occasional interaction** (opening a modal, a dropdown, a drawer) → Standard animation, under 300ms.
- **Rare or first-time moment** (onboarding, empty state, success celebration) → Can be more elaborate.
- **Marketing page vs. product**: marketing pages may use longer, showier motion; product UI must stay fast and purposeful.

Animate when it adds information: spatial continuity (where did this come from?), state feedback (did my click register?), or connection between cause and effect. If the animation answers no question, cut it.

## Decision Framework 2: Which easing?

1. **Element entering or exiting the screen** (modal, dropdown, toast, tooltip) → `ease-out`. The fast start reads as instant response to the user's action.
2. **Element already on screen moving or resizing** (reordering, layout shift, slider) → `ease-in-out`. Natural accelerate-then-brake motion.
3. **Hover / color / shadow change** → `ease` (or a soft ease-out), 150ms.
4. **Constant-speed motion only** (marquee, spinner, progress-as-time) → `linear`.
5. **`ease-in` alone → almost never.** The slow start delays feedback and feels sluggish. Its only legitimate use is as the exit half of a pairing (subtle exit with `ease-in` while enter uses `ease-out`).

Built-in CSS keywords are weak. Prefer custom curves — a good default for enters is `cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)`; the full weak-to-strong curve library is in [techniques.md](techniques.md).

Use a **spring** instead of a curve when motion is gesture-driven or interruptible (drag-to-dismiss, sheets, anything that follows a finger). Springs preserve velocity when interrupted; CSS keyframes restart from zero. Default spring: `{ type: "spring", duration: 0.5, bounce: 0 }` — add bounce (0.1–0.3, never more) only for playful, physical interactions.

## Decision Framework 3: What duration?

| What | Duration |
| --- | --- |
| Hover, press, color/shadow changes | 100–150ms |
| Tooltips, dropdowns, popovers | 150–250ms |
| Modals, drawers, toasts | 200–300ms |
| Page-level transitions | 300–400ms |

Rules of thumb:

- **UI animations stay under 300ms.** If it feels slow, it is slow — cut duration before anything else.
- **Exits run ~20–30% faster than enters** (e.g. enter 250ms, exit 180ms). The user has already decided to leave; don't make them wait.
- **Bigger elements and longer travel get more time**; a full-screen sheet needs more than a tooltip.
- Perceived speed matters as much as real speed — a snappy 180ms dropdown makes the whole app feel faster.

## Core Principles

1. **Animate only `transform` and `opacity`.** They run on the GPU and skip layout/paint. Never animate `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`, `top/left`, or box-shadow spread directly — animate `transform: scale/translate` and cross-fade instead. Keep `filter: blur()` under 20px (expensive, worst on Safari).

2. **Interactive state gets CSS transitions; one-shots get keyframes.** Transitions retarget smoothly when the user reverses mid-animation (open → close while still opening); keyframes restart and look broken. Reserve `@keyframes` for enter sequences and loaders that always run to completion.

   ```css
   .drawer { transform: translateX(-100%); transition: transform 250ms cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1); }
   .drawer[data-open] { transform: translateX(0); }
   ```

3. **Never enter from `scale(0)`.** Elements should always have a visible shape — start at `scale(0.95)` (or `0.97` for small elements) with `opacity: 0`, and settle to `scale(1)`, `opacity: 1`.

4. **Make scaling origin-aware.** Popovers, dropdowns, and tooltips must scale from their trigger, not from center. Set `transform-origin` to the trigger side — Radix and Base UI expose it as a CSS variable:

   ```css
   .popover { transform-origin: var(--radix-popper-transform-origin, var(--transform-origin, top)); }
   ```

5. **Paired elements share timing.** Modal + overlay, drawer + backdrop, tooltip + arrow — if they move as a unit, give them identical duration and easing. Mismatched timing reads as broken.

6. **Press feedback: `scale(0.96)` on `:active`.** Use a CSS transition (150ms, ease-out) so releasing mid-press smoothly returns. Never go below `0.95` — it looks exaggerated. Not every button needs it; skip it on high-frequency controls.

   ```css
   .pressable { transition: scale 150ms ease-out; }
   .pressable:active { scale: 0.96; }
   ```

7. **Exits are quieter than enters.** The user's attention is already on the next thing. Fade out with a small directional nudge (`translateY(-12px)`, opacity 0, ~150ms ease-in) — not a dramatic full-height slide, and not an instant `display: none` that severs spatial context.

8. **Don't animate initial page load state.** Anything that's simply sitting in its resting position when the page appears has no reason to play an entrance — save the motion for state changes the user causes afterward. In Motion, set `initial={false}` on the `AnimatePresence` wrapper for toggles/tabs/icon swaps (but not on genuinely first-run entrances like a staggered hero, where it would skip the whole thing).

9. **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — always.** Every animation you add gets a reduced-motion path. Disable all of it, including opacity fades; no exceptions:

   ```css
   @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
     .modal { animation: none; transition: none; }
   }
   ```

   In Motion, gate `initial`/`animate` values with `useReducedMotion()`.

10. **Gate hover animations to real hover devices.** Touch devices fire hover on tap. Wrap hover motion in `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` (Tailwind v4's `hover:` does this automatically).

11. **Disable transitions during theme switches.** Toggling dark mode should not fire every color transition on the page — temporarily disable transitions when swapping themes.

## Common Mistakes

| Smell | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `transition: all 400ms ease-in` | Name the properties, 200ms, `ease-out` |
| Enter from `scale(0)` or `translateY(100vh)` | `scale(0.95)` + `opacity: 0`, small travel |
| Animating `height`/`width`/`margin` | `transform` + `opacity`; grid-rows or clip tricks for expansion |
| Popover scales from center | `transform-origin` from the trigger |
| Modal and overlay use different durations | Identical duration + easing for paired elements |
| Keyframe animation on an open/close toggle | CSS transition (interruptible) |
| Animating arrow-key navigation / keyboard actions | No animation on keyboard-initiated changes |
| Exit animation longer or louder than enter | Exit ~20–30% faster, subtler |
| Element flickers on hover | Animate a child element so the hover area stays still |
| Shaky 1px jitter at animation start/end | `will-change: transform` on the animated element |
| Sequential tooltips each wait for a delay | First tooltip delays; siblings open instantly |
| No reduced-motion handling | Add the media query / `useReducedMotion()` the moment you add motion |
| New dependency for a simple fade | Use the project's existing stack |

## Review checklist

When reviewing existing animation code, check in order: (1) should this animate at all (frequency)? (2) transform/opacity only? (3) easing matches the enter/move/hover rule? (4) duration under 300ms with faster exit? (5) interruptible? (6) origin-aware? (7) reduced-motion path exists? Report findings as a Before/After markdown table.
