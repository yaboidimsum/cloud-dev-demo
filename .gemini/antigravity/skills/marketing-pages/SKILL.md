# Marketing Pages

Marketing pages earn more animation budget than product UI — a visitor sees a landing page once, not a hundred times a day — but the budget is still small, and most sites overspend it. The pages that convert are fast, readable, and honest: content in the DOM, fonts that don't shift, motion that maps to what the user is doing. Restraint is the house style here, from Emil Kowalski's design engineering practice: skip the scroll theatrics, ship the page pre-rendered, and spend your effort on the details visitors feel but never name. When implementing anything below, match the project's existing styling system — Tailwind, plain CSS, CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS — rather than introducing a new one; and match its framework conventions (the examples use Next.js/React, but the principles are framework-agnostic).

## Core Principles

1. **Motion must map to user input.** No scroll-triggered fade-ups, no scroll hijacking, no parallax that isn't 1:1 with scroll, no auto-advancing carousels. If the user didn't cause it, cut it.
2. **Intro animations play once per session.** Gate them with `sessionStorage` so returning within a session skips them, and new sessions see them fresh.
3. **Pre-render everything.** Blog, docs, changelog — build-time generation with revalidation. Never fetch this content at request time.
4. **Kill layout shift at the source.** Preload fonts and above-the-fold images.
5. **Content lives in the DOM.** Hover-revealed nav submenus are visually hidden, not conditionally rendered — crawlers and assistive tech need the real markup.
6. **CTAs know who's looking.** Logged-out visitors get "Get Started"; logged-in users get "Go to Dashboard".
7. **Docs are for copying.** Every code snippet gets a copy button; every page is exportable as markdown; every concept gets a visual example.
8. **Blogs and changelogs are feeds.** Ship RSS, balance headings.

## Motion Restraint

Marketing pages can be more elaborate than product UI, but the same discipline applies.

**Never add:**
- Scroll animations — fade-ups, fade-ins, translate-Y-on-scroll as sections enter the viewport
- Scroll hijacking
- Parallax that doesn't map 1:1 to scroll position
- Auto-advancing carousels

All of these move without the user asking. Motion disconnected from input feels like the page is performing at you.

**Intro animations** (hero reveals, logo sequences) are fine — once. Skip them on subsequent page views within the same session:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const hasSeenIntro = sessionStorage.getItem('hasSeenIntro');
  if (hasSeenIntro) {
    setSkipIntro(true);
  } else {
    sessionStorage.setItem('hasSeenIntro', 'true');
  }
}, []);
```

Use `sessionStorage`, not `localStorage` — the intro should play again on a genuinely new visit, just not on every internal navigation.

## Performance

**Preload fonts** so text doesn't reflow when the webfont lands:

```jsx
import { preload } from 'react-dom';

// In app initialization
preload('/fonts/inter-var.woff2', { as: 'font', type: 'font/woff2' });
```

**Preload above-the-fold images:**

```html
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="/hero-image.webp" />
```

**Statically generate all content pages.** Blog, changelog, docs, and any frequently updated data: build time + revalidation, never request-time fetching:

```jsx
// Next.js example
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await getPosts();
  return posts.map((post) => ({ slug: post.slug }));
}

export const revalidate = 3600; // Revalidate every hour
```

## Header Navigation

Submenu content that appears on hover must still exist in the DOM at all times — visually hidden, not mounted-on-hover. This keeps the HTML structure real for SEO and accessibility:

```html
<!-- Content exists in DOM, just visually hidden -->
<nav>
  <button aria-expanded="false">Products</button>
  <div class="submenu" aria-hidden="true">
    <!-- Full content here, not dynamically loaded -->
  </div>
</nav>
```

## Call-to-Action Buttons

CTAs adapt to auth state — a logged-in user being told to "Sign Up" is a dead end:

| State | CTA |
| --- | --- |
| Logged out | "Get Started" or "Sign Up" |
| Logged in | "Go to Dashboard" or "Open App" |

```jsx
<Button href={isLoggedIn ? '/dashboard' : '/signup'}>
  {isLoggedIn ? 'Go to Dashboard' : 'Get Started'}
</Button>
```

## Documentation Sites

- **Copy button on every code snippet.** No exceptions — docs code exists to be pasted.
- **Every page copyable as markdown:** a "Copy as Markdown" button, plus `.md` URLs (e.g. `/docs/getting-started.md` returns raw markdown). This serves both humans and the LLMs increasingly reading your docs.
- **Visual examples everywhere.** Code alone isn't enough — show what the code produces. Let people see and ideally touch the result before they commit to using it.

## Blog & Changelog

- **RSS feeds exist** at predictable paths:

  ```
  /blog/rss.xml
  /changelog/rss.xml
  ```

- **Balance headings** so multi-line titles don't leave a stranded word:

  ```css
  article h1, article h2 {
    text-wrap: balance;
  }
  ```

## Code-Built Illustrations

Decorative illustrations built from DOM elements need three things: an accessible name, no text selection, and no pointer interference:

```jsx
<div
  role="img"
  aria-label="Illustration showing data flow"
  className="illustration"
  style={{
    userSelect: 'none',
    pointerEvents: 'none',
  }}
/>
```

Skip `pointerEvents: 'none'` only if the illustration is interactive.
